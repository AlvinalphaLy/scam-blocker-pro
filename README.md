## Overview

ScamShield Pro simulates a real-world phishing attack — you receive messages from an AI scammer that adapts its tactics based on your responses, just like a real social engineering attempt. Your goal is to identify and flag the manipulation tactics before the scammer convinces you.

Built during a hackathon using **Cloudflare Agents SDK** and **Workers AI** (Llama 3.1 8B), the entire app runs on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure with no traditional backend server.

---

## Features

- **Live AI Scammer** — Powered by Llama 3.1 8B via Cloudflare Workers AI. The scammer adapts dynamically to your replies, escalating or backing off based on your responses.
- **Real-time WebSocket Chat** — Persistent connection via Cloudflare Durable Objects. Each game session gets its own isolated stateful agent.
- **Tactic Flagging System** — Identify scam tactics (Authority, False Urgency, Fear, Suspicious Links, etc.) and earn points for correct identifications.
- **Risk Meter** — Tracks your exposure based on unflagged tactics. Drops only on correct flags — wrong guesses don't reward you.
- **3 Difficulty Levels** — Easy (1 tactic/message), Medium (2–3 tactics), Hard (3–4 tactics, aggressive escalation).
- **Session Summary** — Post-game breakdown of caught vs. missed tactics, accuracy, score, and educational tips.

## Architecture

```
Browser
  └── React 19 (Vite)
        └── useAgent() ──WebSocket──▶ Cloudflare Worker (ScamAgent)
                                            ├── AIChatAgent (Durable Object)
                                            │     └── Conversation history (SQLite)
                                            └── Workers AI
                                                  └── Llama 3.1 8B Instruct
```

The frontend connects to a **Cloudflare Durable Object** via WebSocket. Each game session creates a unique Durable Object instance that holds the full conversation history. The AI model streams responses inline with an embedded tactic annotation format (`TACTICS: Authority, False Urgency\n---\nMessage`) that the client parses to power the flagging system — no extra API calls needed.
